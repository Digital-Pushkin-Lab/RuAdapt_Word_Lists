# RuAdapt_Word_Lists

This repository contains word lists that were created from parallel simplification/adaptation data or from other dictionaries and word lists.

**RuAdapt_literature_word_list** is a list of monolingual word alignments taken from the [RuAdapt adapted literature subcorpus](https://github.com/Digital-Pushkin-Lab/RuAdapt/tree/main/Adapted_literature).

**dictionary synonyms** is a list of "regular" words and their synonyms from CEFR-graded vocabulary lists for students of Russian as a foreign language. The list was created for [this project](https://www.hse.ru/en/edu/vkr/182626286) (full text in Russian).
