# RuAdapt_Word_Lists

This repository contains word lists that were created from parallel simplification/adaptation data or from other dictionaries and word lists.

**RuAdapt_literature_word_list** is a list of monolingual word alignments taken from the [RuAdapt adapted literature subcorpus](https://github.com/Digital-Pushkin-Lab/RuAdapt/tree/main/Adapted_literature).

**RuAdapt_literature_word_list_only_good_pairs** is a shorter version of the previous list containing only "good" pairs with higher human evaluation scores. It also contains more information about each pair, including, for example, the words' CEFR grade levels.  

**dictionary synonyms** is a list of "regular" words and their synonyms from CEFR-graded vocabulary lists for students of Russian as a foreign language. The list was created for [this project](https://www.hse.ru/en/edu/vkr/182626286) (full text in Russian).
